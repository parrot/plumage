OVERVIEW
--------

Parrot Plumage (name subject to change) is the future Parrot module
ecosystem.  It will include tools to search metadata, handle dependencies,
install modules, and so forth.

This is the first rough prototype of the toolchain for Parrot Plumage.
The initial overall design document can be found at:

    https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/wiki/ModuleEcosystem

We practice the 'whirpool' development model, so this design document
could at best be described as "getting us close enough to the sucking
vortex to begin our descent".  We expect to make many changes as we
discover new issues during implementation.
