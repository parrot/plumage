OVERVIEW
--------

Parrot Plumage (name subject to change) is the future Parrot module
ecosystem.  It will include tools to search metadata, handle dependencies,
install modules, and so forth.

This is the first rough prototype of the toolchain for Parrot Plumage.
The initial overall design document can be found at:

    https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/wiki/ModuleEcosystem

We practice the 'whirlpool' development model, so this design document
could at best be described as "getting us close enough to the sucking
vortex to begin our descent".  We expect to make many changes as we
discover new issues during implementation.


BUILDING
--------

Configure and make as usual, except the configure script must be run using
Parrot's NQP language:

  $ parrot-nqp Configure.nqp
  $ make
  $ make test

If your Parrot does not have a parrot-nqp binary, this is a strong indication
that your Parrot is too old, and you will need to upgrade it before building
Parrot Plumage.


USING
-----

Once built, Plumage is relatively easy to use, especially if you've used
another install tool such as apt-get or yum.  For example, to install
Rakudo (a Perl 6 implementation), run the following command:

  $ ./plumage install rakudo

This will automatically install any dependencies that Rakudo may need.
To see what those dependencies are, try this:

  $ ./plumage showdeps rakudo

To see what other commands and options are available, ask for usage info:

  $ ./plumage usage

If you have any problems, just come by #parrot at irc.parrot.org and ask.
We're happy to help!


CONTRIBUTING
------------

We aim to be very contributor-friendly here; take a look at the documents
in the docs/hacking/ directory (starting with contributing.pod) to get up
to speed.

Welcome to the crew, and don't forget to be bold!
