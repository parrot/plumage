OVERVIEW
--------

Parrot Plumage (name subject to change) is the future Parrot module
ecosystem.  It will include tools to search metadata, handle dependencies,
install modules, and so forth.

This is the first rough prototype of the toolchain for Parrot Plumage.
The initial overall design document can be found at:

    https://trac.parrot.org/parrot/wiki/ModuleEcosystem

We practice the 'whirpool' development model, so this design document
could at best be described as "getting us close enough to the sucking
vortex to begin our descent".  We expect to make many changes as we
discover new issues during implementation.


BUILDING
--------

Configure and make as usual, except the configure script must be run using
Parrot's NQP interpreter:

  $ parrot_nqp Configure.nqp
  $ make

If your parrot does not have a parrot_nqp binary, then you can achieve
the same result in a somewhat more longwinded fashion:

  $ export NQP_PBC=$(parrot_config libdir)$(parrot_config versiondir)/languages/nqp/nqp.pbc
  $ parrot $NQP_PBC Configure.nqp
  $ make
