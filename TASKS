SHARE-A-TASK

We need these tasks done, and anyone can do them.
Take one and run with it.  Please.


--------
Adding more "builtins" to Glue.pir:

The guiding principles are:

1. Do the most with the least.
2. It doesn't have to be perfect.
3. It's handy if the arguments are similar to the ones in Perl 6.

What we need:

* Filesystem
  * Examples: file tests, more?

* String slinging and especially filesystem path string munging
  * Examples: more?

--------
Data structure merge/overlay

The basic use case: Take a data structure of default configuration or
metadata, overlay it with values from a "user defaults" JSON file, overlay
that with values from a parsed JSON file for a particular project, and then
overlay *that* with command line options or other runtime values.

Two possible ways to do this:

1. Actually merge the trees into a single data structure, replacing "older"
   values with the same key path as "newer" values.

2. Make a proxy object that can store references to several data structures.
   Any lookups in the proxy data structure are looked up in turn in each real
   structure in order until a matching entry is found.  Sets to the proxy are
   passed on to only the real structure which is at the top of the "stack".
   (For convenience in implementation, the writable structure may be special
   in some way, such as always starting empty.)

Teach dalek about Gitorious

dalek is the repository commit feed bot stationed in #parrot.  It understands
Trac-based Subversion repositories, and GitHub-based Git repositories, but
does not yet understand Gitorious feeds, where the parrot-plumage repository
is hosted.

According to Infinoid, dalek's owner:

"It needs a gitorious equivalent of
 http://github.com/Infinoid/dalek-plugins/blob/master/modules/local/githubparser.pm
"
