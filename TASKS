SHARE-A-TASK

We need these tasks done, and anyone can do them.
Take one and run with it.  Please.


--------
Adding more "builtins" to Glue.pir:

The guiding principles are:

1. Do the most with the least.
2. It doesn't have to be perfect.
3. It's handy if the arguments are similar to the ones in Perl 6.

What we need:

* Filesystem
  * Examples: mkdir(), chdir(), cwd(), stat() and/or file tests

* String slinging and especially filesystem path string munging
  * Examples: split(), join(), catdir(), catfile(), etc.

--------
Data structure merge/overlay

The basic use case: Take a data structure of default configuration or
metadata, overlay it with values from a "user defaults" JSON file, overlay
that with values from a parsed JSON file for a particular project, and then
overlay *that* with command line options or other runtime values.

Two possible ways to do this:

1. Actually merge the trees into a single data structure, replacing "older"
   values with the same key path as "newer" values.

2. Make a proxy object that can store references to several data structures.
   Any lookups in the proxy data structure are looked up in turn in each real
   structure in order until a matching entry is found.  Sets to the proxy are
   passed on to only the first of the real structures (which may start empty,
   for convenience in implementation).
