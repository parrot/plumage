  <h2>Usage</h2>

  <p>
  Getting started with Plumage is very simple. Suppose you want to try out a new programming
  language but are not sure which. Let's see what's available:

  <pre>plumage projects</pre>

  The <code>projects</code> command lists all the projects in the ecosystem. Maybe you're feeling
  kinda silly and want to write some <code>lolcode</code>:

  <pre>plumage install lolcode</pre>

  This builds, tests, and installs a particular project/module; in this case, <code>lolcode</code>.
  It could be that you're not really in a lolcatz mood right now. Uninstalling a project is done
  with the aptly named <code>uninstall</code> command:

  <pre>plumage uninstall lolcode</pre>

  There's a lot more you can do with Plumage. You can get more help by running:
